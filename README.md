# Tested audio props tweaks

This version is fully stable and tested on Realme Q5 Pro and Motorola Edge 30 Ultra


Carefully tested props tweaks for clean, immersive, correctly positioned audio and extras.

It would fix cheap DACs sounding harsh. Or grainy / digital-ish vocal you usually find from your phone speakers.

Also bring bluetooth audio very closed to wired bit-perfect audio. Fixed issues with the AAC sounding worse than SBC. LDAC also will be spicy and lack bass no more. Also with less latency now!

This mod gain me trust with the Harman target. Turn out the shoutiness was never from the target itself.

That said it doesn't come without one bug is that changing codec or connecting bluetooth while a track is playing causes the audio to leak to the phone speaker for some reason.

Inspired by Audio Misc Settings and Audio Resamplerate Magisk modules. This mod is easy to control and with using Android's factory's flags, it's pretty much compatible with any devices.

For details on how this mod works, it's recommend that you read my test reports carefully before making any changes. Be responsible.



The result is finalize with AB testing with a group of 4 audiophile friends of mine. Proven with tremendous impression and enjoyments! They do feel like in the luxury!

I've experiences with audio devices at 500$ grade, broke quite a lot of IEMs and speakers while modding and tinkering for credits haha. That amount of money cannot brings this kind of experience.

I've spent 20 total hours to exhaustive test these flags. However I couldn't test all of the combinations and cases. However, this's a very stable implementation of it.

Words are just words until you try this out for yourself!



# Guide

Install inside Magisk or Custom Recovery.

Disable offloading, switching off omx acceleration force the device to use the CPU for audio processing which is bit-perfect.

Offload version saves more battery but sound worse (deprecated).
